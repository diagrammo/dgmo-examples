# Famous Pirates of the Golden Age

## The Most Feared Pirates

### Edward Teach — Blackbeard

> He was known to tie slow-burning fuses into his enormous black beard, creating a terrifying cloud of smoke around his head during battle. This demonic appearance struck fear into the hearts of his enemies before a single cannon was fired.

**Active:** 1716–1718
**Ship:** Queen Anne's Revenge (40 guns)
**Fate:** Killed at the Battle of Ocracoke

### Bartholomew Roberts — Black Bart

> "In an honest service there is thin commons, low wages, and hard labour; in this, plenty and satiety, pleasure and ease, liberty and power."

**Active:** 1719–1722
**Ship:** Royal Fortune
**Fate:** Killed by grapeshot in battle

### Anne Bonny & Mary Read

> Two of the most famous female pirates, both served under Calico Jack Rackham. When their ship was captured, they were reportedly the only ones who fought back while the rest of the crew hid below deck.

**Active:** 1719–1720
**Ship:** William (under Calico Jack)
**Fate:** Captured, escaped execution
