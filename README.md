# Diagrammo Examples

Curated `.dgmo` example files and markdown docs for [Diagrammo](https://diagrammo.app).

Used as a git submodule by:
- **diagrammo-app** — desktop app example gallery
- **diagrammo_app_site** — website playground

## Structure

```
charts/          # Data visualization (bar, line, pie, scatter, etc.)
diagrams/        # Structural / relational (flowchart, sequence, sankey, etc.)
docs/            # Markdown documents with embedded dgmo code fences
```

## Adding Examples

Each `.dgmo` file is the single canonical example for its chart type. The filename (without extension) is used as the identifier.
